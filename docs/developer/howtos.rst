Boxfish How-to's
================
Boxfish is designed to ease the integration of new visualizations, domains and
projections. Python files containing new functionality should be added to the
``mods`` directory of Boxfish and imported in ``mods/__init__.py``. In the
future, user-specified directories will also be scanned for contributed code.
