Filter Box
==========

The Filter Box module is the basic interface for applying filters to data
before they visualized or otherwise manipulated by other modules. As such, it
is mostly a pass-through module. All scene settings are supported, but do not
affect what is shown in the Filter Box, only how the scene information is
applied to the child modules.

Currently the Filter Box supports an arbitrary number of primitive [attribute]
[relation] [value] filters anded together.
