Table Module
============

The table module offers the most direct view into the open table files.
Dragging attributes onto a table will display each attribute as a column in
spreadsheet format. Attributes will be placed into separate tabs based on
which table they come from.

The table module supports selection propagation and thus can be a convenient
way to select and view data in other modules.
