Boxfish v1.0
============

Boxfish is a platform for visualizing performance data across the domains in
which it was collected.  Projections are mappings of objects from one domain
(e.g. communication groups) to another (e.g. hardware processes). Boxfish
includes several such common projections and is designed with the expectation
of new projections and visualizations being contributed.
