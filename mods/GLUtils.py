    """Use this to turn some rendering function of yours into a DisplayList,
       without all the tedious setup.

       Suppose you have a rendering function that looks like this:
           def myRenderFunction():
               # ... Do rendering stuff ...

       And you want to use it to build a displayList:
           myList = DisplayList(myRenderFunction)

       Now to call the list, just do this:
           myList()

       If you want the render function to get called again the next time your
       display list is called, you call "update()" on the display list:
           myList.update()

       Now the next call to myList() will generate you a new display list by
       running your render function again.  After that, it just calls the
       new list.

       Note that your render function *can* take args, and you can pass them
       when you call the display list, but they're only really passed along
       when an update is needed, so it's probably best to just not make
       render functions with arguments.

       TODO: this should probably have ways to keep around active list ids so
       TODO: that they can be freed up at the end of execution.
